<h1>Grilling Safety</h1>
<h2>infographic</h2>
<p>One of the first projects I was assigned at NutriSavings was to design an infographic about grilling safety to be included in one of our monthly newsletters (which you can check out <a href="newsletters.html">here</a>). I recently revamped this infographic to be what you see on the left. But to see it as originally designed, to see where I started, you can <a href="old-grilling-infographic">click here :)</a> Collecting imagery for this as I thought about layout was enjoyable. And, similar to when I designed the <a href="milk-infographic.html">lactose intolerance infographic</a>, I really enjoyed designing the little fire and warning symbol icons. It's about the small things!</p>
