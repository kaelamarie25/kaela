<h1>Do You Have Lactose Intolerance?</h1>
<h2>infographic</h2>
<p>This was one of my favorite projects to work on. I had complete creative freedom, and felt that the provided content was comprehensive and interesting. The goal of the project was to create an effective infographic to inform people about lactose intolerance, and some lactose-free alternatives. It was fun to use a combination of photographic and illustrative imagery, and, similar to when I designed the <a href="grilling-infographic.html">grilling safety infographic</a>, I loved being able to design the milk jug icons myself. It's about the small things! ;)</p>
