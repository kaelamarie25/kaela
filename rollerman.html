<h1>"Roller Man"</h1>
<h2>animation</h2>
<p>This is the first project assigned to me during a computer animation course in college. The only requirement was to use an iPad animation app called FlipBook. I drew each frame of the animation with a stylus, and used my voice and a free iMovie background music file for sound. It may seem pretty basic in terms of style and story; but the assignment as to create something very simple, and I wanted to illustrate it in this raw, sketchy style to go along with that simplicity.</p>
