<h1>CSS Zen Mouth</h1>
<h2>front-end web development</h2>
<p>The first project I was assigned during an advanced web design course I took in college was to design and develop a sort of 'microsite' around the parameters set by <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/" target="_blank">CSS Zen Garden</a>, a free content resource designed to demonstrate what can be accomplished using only CSS. I tend to work very quickly, and this project was no exception. So when I finished my <a href="/kitchen.html">initial project</a> in only 1 of the 3 weeks we were given to complete the project, I decided to make another one. And thus, CSS Zen Mouth was born!<br><br>
Check out the <a href="/mouth-site.html" target="_blank">site</a>!</p>
