<h1>Nothing Wrong With Classic</h1>
<h2>poster / advertisement</h2>
<p>During college, I took a course called Advertising Techniques, and this was one of my best projects produced for that class. The assignment was to select any product, and come up with a tagline and imagery for a campaign around it. Choosing the product was easy for me: I chose Bacardi Dragonberry Rum because I had recently discovered it (heh) and loved it! But I struggled initially with how to position it. I didn't know what I wanted the product to say to the consumer. After researching their brand and looking at past Bacardi advertisements even more, I realized there were quite a few pieces that demonstrate a simple and classic feel. Immediately, the slogan "Nothing wrong with classic" came to my mind. For imagery, I decided to keep it clean to coincide with those existing Bacardi campaigns I'd researched. I thought about some things that typically have a "classic" connotation to them, jotted them down, and conducted a quick poll amongst my classmates to see which of the things that came to my mind also came to theirs. The tuxedo and the record player won by far.</p>
