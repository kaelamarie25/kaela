<h1>Monthly HTML Newsletters</h1>
<h2>digital marketing</h2>
<p>Every month, the marketing department sends out a newsletter that corresponds to the National Health Observances set by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. When I first started, our newsletters looked incredibly outdated, and didn't get many clicks. As I taught myself more and more about HTML emails, I began crafting ways to improve our newsletter, and to turn it into a lead generating tool. Among other changes, I made the newsletter responsive, started using more impactful imagery and CTA copy, and switched up the amount and type of content that we include (such as including more infographics, like <a href="grilling-infographic.html">this one</a>). I designed and developed from scratch the template that is currently used, and we have already started to see leads generated from it! Goal accomplished.<br><br>
