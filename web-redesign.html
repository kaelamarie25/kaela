<h1>Consumer Website Redesign</h1>
<h2>UX / UI</h2>
<p>Part of my role at NutriSavings is to serve as the lead designer for the consumer website redesign. The original site was hastily designed; needless to say there were several problems with it. But perhaps the most glaring issue to me was the home page and its lack of information hierarchy. As it is the first page a user sees upon logging in, I felt the home page should be redesigned first. I started by collecting information about problems with the site, and what should be included in the redesign. Next, I started to design wireframes to make sure that the information we wanted to push, or that users wanted to see first, were at the top. After a couple months of thinking, designing mockups, talking, and <a href="http://www.kaelabryan.com/avatars.html">designing avatars</a>, the end result is a better-functioning dashboard-style home page.<br><br>
