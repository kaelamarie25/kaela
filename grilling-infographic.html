<h1>Grilling Safety</h1>
<h2>infographic</h2>
<p>One of the first projects I was assigned at NutriSavings was to design an infographic about grilling safety to be included in one of our monthly newsletters (which you can check out <a href="newsletters.html">here</a>). Looking back, there are some things I would tweak about the design now, but I decided to leave it as it was originally designed to show where I started. Collecting imagery for this as I thought about layout was enjoyable. And, similar to when I designed the <a href="milk-infographic.html">lactose intolerance infographic</a>, I really enjoyed designing the little fire and warning symbol icons. It's about the small things! ;)</p>
