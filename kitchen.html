<h1>CSS Zen Kitchen</h1>
<h2>front-end web development</h2>
<p>The first project I was assigned during an advanced web design course I took in college was to design and develop a sort of 'microsite' around the parameters set by <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/" target="_blank">CSS Zen Garden</a>, a free content resource designed to demonstrate what can be accomplished using only CSS. One of the first things I thought about when initially approaching this project was how to display the required list of 'resources' and 'other designs' in an interesting way. Right away, it seemed to me almost like a menu. <em>So,</em> I thought, <em>why not create a page based on a restaurant? Or - better yet - an adorable restaurant kitchen?</em> My personal aeshetic tends to lean on the whimsical and childlike, flat and illustrative side. I designed all the imagery in Adobe Illustrator, and since the idea came to me pretty quickly, I was able to design and develop it in only 1 week. Since we were given 3 weeks to complete the project, I also created <a href="/mouth.html">another one</a>. ;)<br><br>
